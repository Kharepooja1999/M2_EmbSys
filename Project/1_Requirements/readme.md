# Smart Blind Stick:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Abstract:
 This project describes ultrasonic blind walking stick with the use of arduino. according to who, 30 million peoples are permanently blind and 285 billion peoples with vision
impairment . if you notice them , you can very well know about it they can’t walk without the help of other. one has to ask guidance to reach their destination. they have to  face morestruggles in their life daily life. using this blind stick , a person can walk more confidently.this stick detects the object in front of the person and give response to the user either by vibrating or through command. so, the person can walk without any fear. this device will be best solution to overcome their difficulties.

# Introduction:

Blind peoples have to face many challenges in their life, one of them is to find their way on the streets. As on the streets, there are so many vehicles and obstacles that may block their way and also may injure them.

So keeping this problem in the mind we developed a Smart blind stick that scans for the obstacles in front of it with the help of an ultrasonic sensor.
# Objectives:

The main objective of this is to provide an application for blind people to detect the obstacles in various directions, detecting pits and manholes on the ground to make free to walk.


# Benifits:

 • Auto detection.
 
 • Having feature to left & right turn alarm signal.
 
 • Obstacle detection with indication support.
 
 • Dig information with indication alarm.
 
 • Simple to use & low cost
 
 # Components:
i)Arduino UNO.

ii)Jumper wires.

iii)Breadboard.

iv)HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.

v)Buzzer.

vi)LED with a 220-ohm resistor.

vii)DC batteries.

# Description:

# Arduino UNO:
Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects. This board can be interfaced with other Arduino boards, Arduino shields, Raspberry Pi boards and can control relays, LEDs, servos, and motors as an output.

Arduino UNO features AVR microcontroller Atmega328, 6 analogue input pins, and 14 digital I/O pins out of which 6 are used as PWM output.

# Breadboard:
The breadboard is the bread-and-butter of DIY electronics. Breadboards allow beginners to get acquainted with circuits without the need for soldering, and even seasoned tinkerers use breadboards as starting points for large-scale projects.

# HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor:
The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor is a sensor used for detecting the distance to an object using sonar. It's ideal for any robotics projects your have which require you to avoid objects, by detecting how close they are you can steer away from them.

# Buzzer:
A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device,[1] which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric (piezo for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke. 

# DC betteries:
DC stands for 'direct current' which means the current only flows in one direction. Batteries and electronic devices like TVs, computers and DVD players use DC electricity - once an AC current enters a device, it's converted to DC. A typical battery supplies around 1.5 volts of DC.



# 4W's And 1H
# Who
The smart stick for the blind as the name suggests is a device for the visually impaired to guide the user to respective destination and avoiding to collide with the obstacles. It uses two ultrasonic sensors HC SR 04 to detect the depth below or the obstacles in between.
# What
Blind stick is an innovative stick designed for visually disabled people for improved navigation. We here propose an advanced blind stick that allows visually challenged people to navigate with ease using advanced technology. 
# When
The smart walking stick is very useful for those people who are visually impaired and are often need help from others. It allows the user to walk freely by detecting obstacles in front of him.
# Where
The blind stick is able to detect the water by integrating with ultrasonic sensor. In this system, the ultrasonic sensors are used to detect obstacles by using.
# How
portrays the overall view of the blind stick. The stick consists of eight ultrasonic sensors at the front side to cover the surrounded area (front, left and right side)
of a visually impaired person and the sensors detected distance of the obstacle .
