# Smart Blind Stick:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Introduction:

Blind peoples have to face many challenges in their life, one of them is to find their way on the streets. As on the streets, there are so many vehicles and obstacles that may block their way and also may injure them.

So keeping this problem in the mind we developed a Smart blind stick that scans for the obstacles in front of it with the help of an ultrasonic sensor.
# Objectives:

The main objective of this is to provide an application for blind people to detect the obstacles in various directions, detecting pits and manholes on the ground to make free to walk.


# Benifits:

 • Auto detection.
 
 • Having feature to left & right turn alarm signal.
 
 • Obstacle detection with indication support.
 
 • Dig information with indication alarm.
 
 • Simple to use & low cost

# 4W's And 1H
# Who
The smart stick for the blind as the name suggests is a device for the visually impaired to guide the user to respective destination and avoiding to collide with the obstacles. It uses two ultrasonic sensors HC SR 04 to detect the depth below or the obstacles in between.
# What
Blind stick is an innovative stick designed for visually disabled people for improved navigation. We here propose an advanced blind stick that allows visually challenged people to navigate with ease using advanced technology. 
# When
The smart walking stick is very useful for those people who are visually impaired and are often need help from others. It allows the user to walk freely by detecting obstacles in front of him.
# Where
The blind stick is able to detect the water by integrating with ultrasonic sensor. In this system, the ultrasonic sensors are used to detect obstacles by using.
# How
portrays the overall view of the blind stick. The stick consists of eight ultrasonic sensors at the front side to cover the surrounded area (front, left and right side)
of a visually impaired person and the sensors detected distance of the obstacle .
